### Tutorial for json ui chest background menus
- Download File
- Place in RP/UI
- Open File
- Change texture and container name with what you need

To change the texture, upload your image to RP/textures/UI or create any folder and put the correct path on the texture line within chest_screen.json

To check for different menu titles, replace the unicodes I have in that file with text, or whatever you have.
Make sure you change the visible line at the top as well.

To remove or add more menu skins, copy and paste the `x_title` and `x_gui` and paste it on the same column.
Make sure you you copy and paste the `x_title@x_title` and `x_gui@x_gui` in the controls section of large_chest_panel.
