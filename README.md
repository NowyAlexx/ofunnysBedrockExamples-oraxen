## Overview

Hey there, fellow Minecraft enthusiasts! This is ofunny, and I've put together this repository to share some Bedrock resource pack examples and scripts that can help you amp up your Minecraft experience. The collection is a work in progress, and I plan to keep expanding it over time.

## Repository Structure

In the root folder of this repository, you'll find various directories, each housing individual examples. Some directories contain resource pack examples that are ready to be dropped into your own project, while others hold standalone scripts designed to perform specific tasks. To assist you in making the most of these resources, relevant directories are accompanied by a README file. These READMEs provide explanations and additional details where necessary, helping you navigate the examples with ease.

Some of the examples provided here are designed to work seamlessly with GeyserMC, a fantastic project that bridges the gap between Minecraft Java Edition and Bedrock Edition.

Many examples are versatile and can be used on Bedrock Edition without any special plugins or tools.
